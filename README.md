# ðŸŽ° Transparent Lottery Smart Contract

A beginner-friendly **Ethereum-based lottery DApp** built using **Solidity**.  
This project demonstrates how blockchain can create a **fair and transparent lottery** system â€” where every entry, rule, and transaction is publicly verifiable on-chain.

## ðŸ§© Project Description

The **Transparent Lottery** smart contract allows users to join a lottery by sending a small amount of cryptocurrency (minimum **0.01 ETH**).  
Once enough participants have joined, the **manager** (the contract deployer) can pick a **random winner**, who receives the **entire balance** of the contract.  

All entries and results are stored **transparently on the blockchain**, ensuring fairness and public auditability.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

1. **Accepts Entries:**  
   Users can participate by sending at least `0.01 ETH` via the `enter()` function.

2. **Stores Participants:**  
   Each participantâ€™s address is stored securely in an on-chain array `players[]`.

3. **Picks a Random Winner:**  
   The contract manager can trigger the `pickWinner()` function,  
   which selects a random player and transfers **all Ether in the contract** to them.

4. **Resets Automatically:**  
   Once a winner is picked, the list of players resets for the next round.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Transparent & Fair:**  
  Every entry, winner, and transaction is publicly visible on the blockchain.

- **Beginner-Friendly Code:**  
  Simple and readable Solidity structure â€” great for learning how Ethereum smart contracts work.

- **Secure Access Control:**  
  Only the contract deployer (manager) can pick a winner.

- **On-Chain Randomness (Demo):**  
  Uses block data (`timestamp`, `prevrandao`) to generate a pseudo-random winner  
  *(for production, you can upgrade to Chainlink VRF for true randomness)*.
